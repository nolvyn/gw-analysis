# gw-analysis
Code to analyze and quantify the differences between gravitational waveform models.

The files for events which this analysis is conducted on can be found here:

In order to perform analysis on waveform models in the EOBNR and NR families, lalsimulation files are required to be obtained.

These can be found here:

This analysis make extensive use of PyCBC and NumPy.
