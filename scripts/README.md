Event Setup:
Due to rate limiting from Zenodo, the event setup script may need to be run multiple times.

Model Setup:
The files from https://git.ligo.org/waveforms/software/lalsuite-waveform-data may need to be downloaded manually instead of git cloned.

IGWN Setup:
The igwn-minimal environment contains only the bare minimum packages needed to run the code in this repository. The igwn environment contains all packages and their exact versions that are used in other IGWN environments.
